*Don't start training yet - just explore!*

---

### Step 6: Explore Fine-tuning (2 minutes)

**See LoRA Configuration:**

1. **Go to 🎯 Fine-tuning Tab**
2. **Notice LoRA settings:**
   - Rank: 8 (lower = fewer parameters)
   - Alpha: 16
   - Dropout: 0.05
3. **See the QLoRA checkbox**
   - Combines 4-bit quantization with LoRA
   - Maximum memory efficiency!
4. **Browse the model path selector**

---

### Step 7: Check Export Options (2 minutes)

**ONNX Export Preview:**

1. **Go to 📦 Export & Eval Tab**
2. **See ONNX settings:**
   - Opset version selector
   - Optimization checkbox
   - Dynamic axes option
3. **Check benchmark settings:**
   - Batch size
   - Sequence length
   - Iterations
4. **Note the "Run Benchmark" button**

---

### Step 8: View Model Management (2 minutes)

**Checkpoint Browser:**

1. **Go to 🗂️ Models Tab**
2. **Click "Refresh"**
   - Shows any existing checkpoints
   - Scans common directories
3. **Notice the actions:**
   - Load selected checkpoint
   - Delete selected checkpoint
   - Model information display

## 🐛 Common First-Time Issues

### Issue: "PyQt6 not found"
**Fix:**
```bash
pip install PyQt6
```

### Issue: "No model loaded" in Inference
**Fix:**
This is normal! The dashboard doesn't come with a pre-trained model. You need to:
1. Train a model first (Training tab), OR
2. Load an existing checkpoint (Models tab)

### Issue: "Dataset loader not available"
**Fix:**
Make sure `dataset_loader.py` is in the same directory as `mamba_dashboard.py`

### Issue: Can't find checkpoints
**Fix:**
Checkpoints are saved to:
- `./checkpoints/`
- `./outputs/`
- `./models/`

Create these directories or train a model to create them automatically.

## 💡 Pro Tips for First Session

### Tip 1: Start Simple
Don't try to use all features at once. Pick one workflow:
- Just explore the interface
- OR just try inference
- OR just load a dataset
- OR just configure training

### Tip 2: Use Defaults
The default settings are good! You don't need to change everything.
- Default model size: Perfect for learning
- Default learning rate: Well-tuned
- Default optimizations: Recommended

### Tip 3: Enable Streaming
In Inference tab, always enable "Streaming Generation"
- More engaging to watch
- Feels faster
- Can see generation in real-time

### Tip 4: Save Often
Use the Models tab to check your checkpoints regularly
- Training auto-saves
- But good to verify
- Easy to organize

### Tip 5: Experiment Freely
The GUI makes it safe to experiment!
- Can't break anything by clicking
- Easy to reset settings
- Clear error messages
